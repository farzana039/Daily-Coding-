Given a String S,containing special characters and alphabets ,reverse the string without affecting the positions of the special characters

Steps Followed:

To reverse the string without affecting the positions of the special characters, we can approach the problem as follows:

1.Extract all the alphabetic characters from the string.
2.Reverse the extracted alphabetic characters.
3.Rebuild the string by placing the reversed characters back into their respective positions, leaving the special characters untouched.

Explanation:

Step 1: We use list comprehension to collect only the alphanumeric characters (isalnum() checks for letters and numbers).
Step 2: The list of alphabets is reversed using the reverse() method.
Step 3: We loop through the original string and place each character back, replacing alphabetic ones with those from the reversed list and leaving the special characters in place.
