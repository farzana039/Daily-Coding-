Given an array,if we have remove the maximum 2 numbers and return the rest of the array in sorted form 

Explanation

1.Sort the Array:
Sorting will place all the numbers in ascending order.
The two largest numbers will be at the last two positions of the array.
2.Remove the Largest Numbers:
Use slicing to remove the last two elements of the sorted array.
3.Return the Remaining Numbers:
The result will be the rest of the elements, already in sorted order

Time Complexity:O(nlogn).

Space Complexity: O(1)
