Given an array which consists of positive num,negative num,zero digits. we have to count it and return its ratios of each count with the decimal of 6 places

Approach:
1.We need to count the number of positive, negative, and zero elements in the array. 
2.Then, calculate their respective ratios by dividing each count by the total number of elements. 
3.Finally, return the ratios formatted to 6 decimal places.

Explanation:
1.Use a list comprehension with sum to count the number of positive (x > 0), negative (x < 0), and zero (x == 0) numbers.
2.Each count is divided by the total number of elements (n) to calculate its ratio.
3.Ratios are formatted to 6 decimal places using Python's formatted string syntax (f"{value:.6f}").
