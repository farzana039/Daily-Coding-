# Daily Coding Practice

Welcome to my **Daily Coding Practice** repository! 

This repository is where I document my journey of improving coding skills by solving various coding problems daily. By consistently practicing, I aim to enhance my problem-solving abilities and gain deeper insights into algorithms, data structures, and programming concepts.

## Programming Languages Used
- Python 🐍
(Additional languages may be added as I explore more technologies.)

## Problem Sources

The problems I solve come from a variety of platforms, including:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- [PrepInsta Prime](https://prepinstaprime.com/) (currently using this for exam preparation)

## Goals 🎯

1. **Consistency:** Solve at least one coding problem daily.
2. **Improvement:** Gradually tackle problems of increasing complexity.
3. **Diversity:** Work on different topics like arrays, strings, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms.

## Highlights

- Solutions include detailed comments to explain the thought process.
- Includes various difficulty levels from beginner to advanced.
