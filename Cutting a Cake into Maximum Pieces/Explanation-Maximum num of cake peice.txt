The problem involves finding the maximum number of cake pieces that can be created with a given number of straight cuts

The maximum number of pieces (P(n)) created with n cuts follows a mathematical pattern:

Observation:

With 0 cuts, there is only 1 piece (the whole cake).
With 1 cut, the cake is divided into 2 pieces.
With 2 cuts, if the second cut intersects the first, there are 4 pieces.
With 3 cuts, if the third cut intersects all previous cuts, there are 7 pieces.

Pattern: The number of pieces increases as follows:
P(n)=P(n−1)+n

This means the current number of pieces equals the previous number of pieces plus the number of additional pieces created by the new cut.

Formula: The formula to calculate the maximum number of pieces for n cuts is:

P(n)= n×(n+1)/2 +1
This is derived from the sum of the first n natural numbers  ,plus the initial piece of the cake.

Approach:
1.Take the number of cuts (n) as input.
2.Use the formula
3.Return the result.

Time Complexity
O(1): The formula directly computes the result.
Space Complexity
O(1): No extra space is used.
