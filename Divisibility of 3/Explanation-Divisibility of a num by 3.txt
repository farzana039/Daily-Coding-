Form a number divisible by 3 using array digits.Given an array of integers of length N,the task is to find whether it;s possible to construct an integer using all the digits of these numbers such that it would be divisible by 3.If it is possible then print 1 and if not print 0

Explanation:
1.Digit_sum is used to store the sum of all digits extracted from the numbers in the array.
2.For each number, extract its digits and add them to the sum using modulo operator
3.Check if the final sum is divisible by 3.
4.if the final sum is divisible by 3 then return 1 else return 0

Total complexity: O(n).
Space Complexity:O(1).
