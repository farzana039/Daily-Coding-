To check whether a given string is a Isogram

Explanation:

Step 1: Convert the input string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity
Step 2: Create an empty set to track characters we've already encountered
Step 3: Iterate through each character in the string
Step 4: Check if the character is an alphabet (ignore spaces, numbers, and symbols)
Step 5: If the character is already in the set, it's a duplicate
Step 6: Add the character to the set to track it as seen
Step 7: If no duplicates are found, return True (it's an isogram)
