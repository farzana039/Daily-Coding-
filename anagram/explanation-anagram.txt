1.Check if the lengths of both strings are the same
2.If lengths are different, they can't be anagrams
3.Initialize two empty dictionaries to count frequencies of characters
4.Loop through each character in both strings
5.Update frequency count for the character in string 's'
 6.Update frequency count for the character in string 't'
 7.Compare the frequency dictionaries of both strings
 8.If they are equal, the strings are anagrams
