Problem
You are given a string s where each character represents a "color" (e.g., R for red and G for green). Some characters are in one color, and some are in another. Your task is to convert all the characters in the string to the same color (either all R or all G) using the minimum number of changes.

Explanation
1.The colors are represented as characters, like R (for red) and G (for green).
2.Count how many of each color exists in the string using count function in the string
3.Return the minimum of these two counts because converting the smaller group results in the fewest changes
