Given a string s, Your task is to complete the function encode that returns the run length encoded string for the given string.
eg if the input string is “wwwwaaadexxxxxx”, then the function should return “w4a3d1e1x6″.
You are required to complete the function encode that takes only one argument the string which is to be encoded and returns the encoded string.

Example 1:

Input:
s = aaaabbbccc
Output: a4b3c3
Explanation: a repeated 4 times consecutively b 3 times, c also 3 times.


1.If the input string is empty, return an empty string
2.Initialize an empty string to store the encoded result
3.Start with a count of 1 for the first character
4.Iterate through the string starting from the second character
5.Check if the current character is the same as the previous one.If yes, increment the count
6.If the character changes, append the previous character and its count
7.Append the last character and its count
8.Return the last final string


Time Complexity: 
O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
Space Complexity: 
O(n), due to the space needed to store the input string and the encoded result.
