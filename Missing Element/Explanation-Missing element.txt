This function is designed to find the missing element in an array of size 𝑁 to N−1, where the integers in the array range from 1 to N, with exactly one number missing

Steps
1.Calculate the expected sum of integers from 1 to N by using the formula n*(n+1)/2
2.Calculate the elements sums in array using sum function
3.The missing element is simply the difference between the total sum and the sum of the elements in the array
4.Return the missing element
5.We have to take input of N and arr from the user 
6.If arr is not equal to N-1,a warning is printed else missing element is returned

Time Complexity: 
O(n) — because the sum of the array elements is the most time-consuming step.
Space Complexity: 
O(n) — because the input array takes
