Given numbers of vehicles (both car and bike ) ,and wheels (both car and bike ) as input .we have to find that how many cars and how many bikes will be manufactured with this input

Explanation

1.Inputs Checking:
Total wheels (W) must be even because every vehicle has at least 2 wheels.
2𝑉≤𝑊≤4𝑉 ensures the input is valid (each vehicle is either a bike with 2 wheels or a car with 4 wheels).
2.Calculation:(mathematical equation)
Cars are calculated using 
C= W−2V/2
Bikes are calculated as 
B=V−C.
3.Output:
The number of cars and bikes is printed.
If the input is invalid, a descriptive error message is displayed.
